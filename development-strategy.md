| _Step Name_ | User Story | Changes in HTML | Changes in CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Live Boilerplate__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I can navigate to an empty website so that I know the project is set up correctly | An empty template project with `doctype`, language, charset, `head` & `body`, and hide/reveal script & styles | an empty main `style.css` and an existing evaluation style |
| __HTML-form__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I can open the website so that i can see a search form | Create a form | none |
| __font-style__ | As an enthusiastic HYF student I can see pretty search | none | create css |
| (descriptive name) | (user story) | (what did you add to the HTML?) | (what did you add to the CSS?) |
